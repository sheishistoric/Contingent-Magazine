About the ``inc/`` directory
---------------------------

When you download the theme you'll notice that the /inc folder contains most of the add-on functionality for the parent theme and all of these files are then loaded up via functions.php

Pluggable (overridable) Largo functions
---------------------------------------

Many of Largo's core functions are pluggable so you can write your own version of them by using the same function name in a child theme's ``functions.php``.

You can read up on how that works in the `WordPress codex section about child themes <https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes>`_.

See: `Function Reference <../api/index.html>`_.

Theme Options and the Options Framework
---------------------------------------

Largo uses the `Options Framework <https://wordpress.org/plugins/options-framework/>`_ for the Appearance > Theme Options menu pages.

If you need to access a Theme Options value, use ``of_get_option()`` instead of the usual ``get_option()``. The theme options pages themselves can be customized from ``options.php`` in the main theme folder.

Homepage Templates
------------------

See `Homepage layouts <https://github.com/INN/Largo-Sample-Child-Theme/tree/master/homepages>`_ from our `Largo-Sample-Child-Theme repository <https://github.com/INN/Largo-Sample-Child-Theme>`_.

LESS and CSS
------------

The Largo parent theme uses `LESS CSS <http://lesscss.org/>`_ to generate the stylesheets including a number of elements borrowed and tweaked from `Twitter Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/>`_.

You will notice that the theme's main style.css is empty except for the header block because we enqueue our styles from ``css/style.css`` (the output of /less/style.less when it's compiled), overriding the WordPress default behavior of including the ``style.css`` file in the root of the theme directory.

TGM Plugin Activation
---------------------

We use `TGM Plugin Activation <https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation>`_ to package a couple of plugins with the Largo theme that are not currently available in the WordPress plugin directory and to recommend plugins for a number of tasks that are commonly requested for news websites.

- The rest of the theme files and the folder structure should be familiar to most WordPress developers, but if you have any questions, feel free to send us an email at largo@inn.org

Compiling translation files
---------------------------

To rebuild the translation files, run the following commands: ::

	grunt pot
	msgmerge -o lang/es_ES.po.merged lang/es_ES.po lang/largo.pot
	mv lang/es_ES.po.merged lang/es_ES.po
	grunt po2mo
